# Refactoring Plan for RSI Tracker App

This document outlines the plan for refactoring the RSI Tracker app to address the following requirements:

1. Fix styling issues that affect other elements when changes are made
2. Create reusable components
3. Improve memory management with Redux Toolkit
4. Better organize constants, utils, sizes, colors, and SVGs
5. Ensure smooth UI without disturbing the current design

## 1. Styling Refactoring

### Current Issues
- Monolithic styling in a single StyleSheet object
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Duplicate styles with slight variations
- Mixed responsibilities in style files
- Hard-coded values in some styles

### Proposed Solutions
- **Component-Specific Styles**: Move styles from the global stylesheet to component-specific files
- **Styled Components Pattern**: Implement a pattern where each component has its own styles file
- **Enhanced Theme System**: Expand the theme system to include more variables and support for light/dark modes
- **Consistent Naming**: Implement a consistent naming convention for styles
- **Remove Duplicates**: Consolidate duplicate styles into reusable ones

## 2. Reusable Components

### Current Issues
- Large components with multiple responsibilities
- Conditional rendering that creates different UIs within the same component
- Repetitive code patterns
- Lack of component composition

### Proposed Solutions
- **Atomic Design**: Implement an atomic design approach with atoms, molecules, and organisms
- **Component Extraction**: Extract smaller, reusable components from larger ones:
  - DataCell: A reusable cell component for the table
  - TableRow: A base component for rows that can be extended
  - Button: A reusable button component with variants
  - Card: A reusable card component for sections
  - Typography: Reusable text components with different styles
- **Component Composition**: Use composition to build complex UIs from simple components

## 3. Memory Management with Redux Toolkit

### Current Issues
- Potential memory leaks in useEffect hooks
- Non-normalized data structure
- Lack of memoized selectors
- Basic Redux Toolkit implementation

### Proposed Solutions
- **Enhanced Redux Store**:
  - Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
  - Normalize data for better performance
  - Add memoized selectors with createSelector
  - Implement Redux Persist for state persistence
  - Add middleware for better debugging and performance monitoring
- **Optimized Rendering**:
  - Use React.memo for pure components
  - Implement shouldComponentUpdate or React.PureComponent for class components
  - Use useCallback and useMemo hooks appropriately

## 4. File Organization

### Current Issues
- Some mixing of concerns in files
- Incomplete separation of constants, utils, etc.
- Limited documentation

### Proposed Solutions
- **Enhanced Directory Structure**:
  ```
  src/
  ├── assets/            # Images, fonts, etc.
  ├── components/        # Reusable components
  │   ├── atoms/         # Basic building blocks
  │   ├── molecules/     # Combinations of atoms
  │   └── organisms/     # Complex UI sections
  ├── constants/         # All constants
  ├── hooks/             # Custom hooks
  ├── services/          # API and other services
  ├── store/             # Redux store
  │   ├── slices/        # Redux slices
  │   └── selectors/     # Memoized selectors
  ├── styles/            # Global styles and themes
  ├── theme/             # Theme configuration
  │   ├── colors.ts      # Color definitions
  │   ├── sizes.ts       # Size definitions
  │   ├── typography.ts  # Typography definitions
  │   └── index.ts       # Theme exports
  ├── types/             # TypeScript types
  └── utils/             # Utility functions
  ```
- **Consistent Naming**: Implement a consistent naming convention for files and directories
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to all functions, components, and types

## 5. Smooth UI

### Current Issues
- Potential performance issues with large datasets
- Limited animation and transition effects
- Possible rendering optimizations

### Proposed Solutions
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Implement virtualized lists for large datasets
  - Optimize rendering with React.memo and useMemo
  - Use requestAnimationFrame for animations
- **Smooth Animations**:
  - Add subtle animations for state changes
  - Implement smooth transitions between screens
  - Use React Native's Animated API for performance
- **Maintain Current Design**:
  - Ensure all changes maintain the current look and feel
  - Test on multiple devices to ensure consistency
  - Get user feedback on changes

## Implementation Plan

The refactoring will be implemented in the following phases:

### Phase 1: File Organization and Setup
- Reorganize the directory structure
- Create new files for constants, utils, etc.
- Set up the enhanced theme system

### Phase 2: Styling Refactoring
- Create component-specific style files
- Implement the styled components pattern
- Update the theme system

### Phase 3: Reusable Components
- Extract atomic components
- Implement component composition
- Update existing components to use the new ones

### Phase 4: Redux Toolkit Enhancements
- Normalize the data structure
- Add memoized selectors
- Implement Redux Persist
- Add performance monitoring

### Phase 5: UI Optimizations
- Implement virtualized lists
- Add smooth animations and transitions
- Optimize rendering performance

### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement
- Test on multiple devices
- Get user feedback
- Make final adjustments

## Conclusion

This refactoring plan aims to address all the requirements while maintaining the current functionality and design of the app. The changes will be implemented incrementally to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth transition.
